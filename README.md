# üñ•Ô∏è LinkedIn Job Analysis for Business Intelligence and Analytics

This project focuses on the **analysis of job offers on LinkedIn** in the fields of **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Analytics**, specifically tailored for graduates of ENSIAS. The objective is to assess the alignment between academic training and the skills required by the job market.

## üìã Project Overview

Using **web scraping** techniques with **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**, we collected data from job postings and ENSIAS alumni profiles on LinkedIn. The scraped data was analyzed and visualized using **Power BI** to identify trends in job demand and compare these with the training provided by ENSIAS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracting job offers and alumni profile data from LinkedIn.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming data for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Analyzing and visualizing job market trends with Power BI.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the skills required by the job market with those acquired during the academic program.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Selenium: Web scraping for job offers.
  - BeautifulSoup: Extracting alumni profiles.
  - Pandas: Data manipulation.
  - Power BI: Data visualization.
- **Other Tools**:
  - Chromedriver for Selenium automation.
  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Job offers were scraped from LinkedIn using keywords like "Business Intelligence" and "Analytics."
   - Alumni profiles were scraped from LinkedIn to identify their current employers and certifications.
   
2. **Data Processing**: 
   - After data collection, the job postings were cleaned, removing duplicates and standardizing location and dates.
   - Extracted key skills from job descriptions using regular expressions.
   
3. **Visualization**: 
   - Created interactive dashboards in **Power BI** for analyzing the distribution of job offers, required skills, and alumni profiles.
   
## üìù Key Insights

- **Top Employers**: Companies like **Agoda** and **CGI** offered the most job positions in BI and Analytics.
- **Top Skills**: Tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and programming languages like **Python** and **R** were highly demanded.
- **Geographical Hotspots**: Most job offers were concentrated in **Casablanca** and **Rabat**, Morocco.

## üìö Future Improvements

- Expanding the dataset to include job postings from other platforms such as **Indeed** and **Glassdoor**.
- Incorporating **machine learning** models to predict job trends in the BI & Analytics domain.
